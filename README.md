#  Gymder

## Building & Running

Build the `Gymder` target in Xcode to run either on a simulator or a connected iOS device.

## Testing

You can either run the tests via Xcode's testing UI or on the command line via a command similar to

    xcodebuild test -scheme Gymder -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 12 Pro'

## Todo

### Layout

I'm still tweaking the layout so that the title bar and buttons don't take up too much space on smaller devices. Additionally I am going
to restrain the aspect ratio of the cards so that they don't go crazy wide on a rotated iPad.
